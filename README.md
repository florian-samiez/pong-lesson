Simple Pong in Rust
======
**Simple Pong in Rust** is a very basic pong game. This has been developed by taking [this tutorial](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/tutorial/) ans then add some feature and refactoring the code.

This project is only for educational purposes, however feel free to give me feedback on both substance and form.
